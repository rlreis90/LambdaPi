This project is a port of Andres Löh's, Conor McBride's and Wouter Swierstra's paper "A tutorial implementation of a dependently typed lambda calculus" (thus called "Lambda Pi") into GitHub for tinkering.

The original paper can be found in the root directory for this project. All credit belongs to them, the original authors of the paper and accompanying source code.
